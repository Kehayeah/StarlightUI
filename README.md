# Project "Starlight"

This is an attempt to add a new display to my car, because it didn't have one to begin with.

It uses can-bus to communicate with the RD45 Radio, and display info like stations, CD text, USB text and some basic Bluetooth stuff (Status, calls, Music info)
Also used to display trip computer info.

To be used with PSA vehicles using the AEE2004 CAN arch.

A complete and detailed explanation will come soon!
